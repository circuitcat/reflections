When would you create a remote vs local repository?

Depends on if you need to work on the files locally or share them to colaborate.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If your project isn't ready to share with others yet, it doesn't make sense to sync it, so manual is the best way.
