When would you create a remote vs local repository?

Depends on if you need to work on the files locally or share them to colaborate.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If your project isn't ready to share with others yet, it doesn't make sense to sync it, so manual is the best way.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are clones done on GitHub. Clones are complete copies of a repository. Branches are part of a repository that track changes separatly from other bracnhes. So you might creat a branch to try out a new feature locally. You might make a clone to get a copy of a repository you want to use. If you use GitHub, Fork is the way you do a clone, but fork also has a few more features like linking back to the source and tracking how many forks there are.
