Lesson 2

git init
	- starts an empty git repository
	- nothing is tracked or staged yet

git add
	- adds files to the staging area
	- staging area can be made into a commit to track revisions

git status
	- shows status of git repository
	- even if there are no commits, ou can see what is staged or not tracked

staging area
	- need to add files to this area before they can be tracked

working directory

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the wd contains everything - the sa has only what we want in the commit
the sa lets you control what gets tracked and what doesn't
