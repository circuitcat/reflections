Version Control Be Good

Manual vs. Auto Commits
	- Manual gives most control, but you may forget to do it
	- Auto creates commits that don't make logical sense, but at least you don't forget to do it

Multi-File Commits
	- Some projects consist of a bundle of multiple files, so it makes sense to track changes together
	- Other times you have one file and no need to track changes across files

git log
	- shows recent git activity
	- you can see the ID's of the repositories

git diff id1 id2
	- shows the difference between two repositories by id

hints
	- use down arrow to scroll down the output from git
	- use q to stop viewing output from git

Using Checkout
	- You can checkout any previous commit and all your files revert
	- You can easily go between commits to see where a bug started
	- You can start a new branch when you checkout, or not
	- You can make changes with confidence that you can always go back to a previous commit if need be

Use git for what you please

Initializing a repository
	- go to the dir and type "git init"
	- creates an empty repository
	- type "git status" to see, you guessed it, the status
